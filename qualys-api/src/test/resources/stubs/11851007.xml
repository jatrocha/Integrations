This includes the [file] 'Owner,' members of his system 'Group,' and the 'Other' users (who are not in his group).  If no UMASK is set, default permissions will be '666' on a text file, granting 'read/write' (permissions) to 'user/group/other,' with the setting '777' on a directory/executable file, granting 'read/write/execute' to all.  If these default permissions are not changed, any user on the system can potentially read/write/execute ALL of the user files, or even block access by the file owner, by using the 'chmod' utility.  This capability would allow disclosure of sensitive information and a potential DoS condition.  By setting the default UMASK to '077' this sets all file/directory permissions to the most highly restrictive level, with 'read/write/execute' set for the owner and 'no access' to all others (excluding the 'root' user).  NOTE: The most common UMASK settings is '022,' resulting in a '755' permissions level, which allows 'read/write/execute' access for the 'Owner and 'read/execute' for the 'Group' and 'Other' users.]]></RATIONALE>

This includes the [file] 'Owner,' members of his system 'Group,' and the 'Other' users (who are not in his group).  If no UMASK is set, default permissions will be '666' on a text file, granting 'read/write' (permissions) to 'user/group/other,' with the setting '777' on a directory/executable file, granting 'read/write/execute' to all.  If these default permissions are not changed, any user on the system can potentially read/write/execute ALL of the user files, or even block access by the file owner, by using the 'chmod' utility.  This capability would allow disclosure of sensitive information and a potential DoS condition.  By setting the default UMASK to '077' this sets all file/directory permissions to the most highly restrictive level, with 'read/write/execute' set for the owner and 'no access' to all others (excluding the 'root' user).  NOTE: The most common UMASK settings is '022,' resulting in a '755' permissions level, which allows 'read/write/execute' access for the 'Owner and 'read/execute' for the 'Group' and 'Other' users.]]></RATIONALE>

The SMIT allows just about any administrative task to be performed from its interface as they are grouped logically in a hierarchical fashion for easy access and use.  By default, these log files are created in the Home Directory of the user accessing the SMIT utility.  Given the power a user can wield having access to the SMIT, it is important to protect the logs capturing the actions performed with it.  Periodically run this check to ensure only approved and appropriate individuals have the ability to modify/delete these log files.  By default, these files are not deleted or monitored for size which could result in a potential operational problem or denial of service attack vector as these log files could grow uncontrolled filling all available disk space.  If stored on the system drive, this could cause the system's performance to become degraded to unacceptable levels or to fail completely.]]></RATIONALE>

If no UMASK is set, default permissions will be '666' on a text file, granting 'read/write' (permissions) to 'user/group/other,' with the setting '777' on a directory/executable file, granting 'read/write/execute' to all.

This includes the [file] 'Owner,' members of his system 'Group,' and the 'Other' users (who are not in his group).  If no UMASK is set, default permissions will be '666' on a text file, granting 'read/write' (permissions) to 'user/group/other,' with the setting '777' on a directory/executable file, granting 'read/write/execute' to all.  If these default permissions are not changed, any user on the system can potentially read/write/execute ALL of the user files, or even block access by the file owner, by using the 'chmod' utility.  This capability would allow disclosure of sensitive information and a potential DoS condition.  By setting the default UMASK to '077' this sets all file/directory permissions to the most highly restrictive level, with 'read/write/execute' set for the owner and 'no access' to all others (excluding the 'root' user).  NOTE: The most common UMASK settings is '022,' resulting in a '755' permissions level, which allows 'read/write/execute' access for the 'Owner and 'read/execute' for the 'Group' and 'Other' users.]]></RATIONALE>

This includes the [file] 'Owner,' members of his system 'Group,' and the 'Other' users (who are not in his group).  If no UMASK is set, default permissions will be '666' on a text file, granting 'read/write' (permissions) to 'user/group/other,' with the setting '777' on a directory/executable file, granting 'read/write/execute' to all.  If these default permissions are not changed, any user on the system can potentially read/write/execute ALL of the user files, or even block access by the file owner, by using the 'chmod' utility.  This capability would allow disclosure of sensitive information and a potential DoS condition.  By setting the default UMASK to '077' this sets all file/directory permissions to the most highly restrictive level, with 'read/write/execute' set for the owner and 'no access' to all others (excluding the 'root' user).  NOTE: The most common UMASK settings is '022,' resulting in a '755' permissions level, which allows 'read/write/execute' access for the 'Owner and 'read/execute' for the 'Group' and 'Other' users.]]></RATIONALE>

This includes the [file] 'Owner,' members of his system 'Group,' and the 'Other' users (who are not in his group).  If no UMASK is set, default permissions will be '666' on a text file, granting 'read/write' (permissions) to 'user/group/other,' with the setting '777' on a directory/executable file, granting 'read/write/execute' to all.  If these default permissions are not changed, any user on the system can potentially read/write/execute ALL of the user files, or even block access by the file owner, by using the 'chmod' utility.  This capability would allow disclosure of sensitive information and a potential DoS condition.  By setting the default UMASK to '077' this sets all file/directory permissions to the most highly restrictive level, with 'read/write/execute' set for the owner and 'no access' to all others (excluding the 'root' user).  NOTE: The most common UMASK settings is '022,' resulting in a '755' permissions level, which allows 'read/write/execute' access for the 'Owner and 'read/execute' for the 'Group' and 'Other' users.]]></RATIONALE>

            <RATIONALE><![CDATA[The 'smit.log' file is responsible for capturing System Management Interface Tool (SMIT) activities.  The SMIT allows just about any administrative task to be performed from its interface as they are grouped logically in a hierarchical fashion for easy access and use.  By default, these log files are created in the Home Directory of the user accessing the SMIT utility.  Given the power a user can wield having access to the SMIT, it is important to protect the logs capturing the actions performed with it.  Periodically run this check to ensure only approved and appropriate individuals have the ability to modify/delete these log files.  By default, these files are not deleted or monitored for size which could result in a potential operational problem or denial of service attack vector as these log files could grow uncontrolled filling all available disk space.  If stored on the system drive, this could cause the system's performance to become degraded to unacceptable levels or to fail completely.]]></RATIONALE>

By default, these files are not deleted or monitored for size which could result in a potential operational problem or denial of service attack vector as these log files could grow uncontrolled filling all available disk space.

This includes the [file] 'Owner,' members of his system 'Group,' and the 'Other' users (who are not in his group).  If no UMASK is set, default permissions will be '666' on a text file, granting 'read/write' (permissions) to 'user/group/other,' with the setting '777' on a directory/executable file, granting 'read/write/execute' to all.  If these default permissions are not changed, any user on the system can potentially read/write/execute ALL of the user files, or even block access by the file owner, by using the 'chmod' utility.  This capability would allow disclosure of sensitive information and a potential DoS condition.

The SMIT allows just about any administrative task to be performed from its interface as they are grouped logically in a hierarchical fashion for easy access and use.

Given the power a user can wield having access to the SMIT, it is important to protect the logs capturing the actions performed with it.  Periodically run this check to ensure only approved and appropriate individuals have the ability to modify/delete these log files.  By default, these files are not deleted or monitored for size which could result in a potential operational problem or denial of service attack vector as these log files could grow uncontrolled filling all available disk space.

The lockout requirement will help block malicious users from gaining access to the host via automated, repetitive brute-force login exploits that involve trying different passwords until one fits a valid userid.  Setting the failed login limit to an appropriate value locks the user account, which severely limits the speed of such attacks, making it more likely that the attacker's pattern will be noticed and the offending source address and/or port can be blocked.]]></RATIONALE>

            <RATIONALE><![CDATA[The 'smit.log' file is responsible for capturing System Management Interface Tool (SMIT) activities.  The SMIT allows just about any administrative task to be performed from its interface as they are grouped logically in a hierarchical fashion for easy access and use.  By default, these log files are created in the Home Directory of the user accessing the SMIT utility.  Given the power a user can wield having access to the SMIT, it is important to protect the logs capturing the actions performed with it.  Periodically run this check to ensure only approved and appropriate individuals have the ability to modify/delete these log files.  By default, these files are not deleted or monitored for size which could result in a potential operational problem or denial of service attack vector as these log files could grow uncontrolled filling all available disk space.  If stored on the system drive, this could cause the system's performance to become degraded to unacceptable levels or to fail completely.]]></RATIONALE>

The SMIT allows just about any administrative task to be performed from its interface as they are grouped logically in a hierarchical fashion for easy access and use.  By default, these log files are created in the Home Directory of the user accessing the SMIT utility.  Given the power a user can wield having access to the SMIT, it is important to protect the logs capturing the actions performed with it.  Periodically run this check to ensure only approved and appropriate individuals have the ability to modify/delete these log files.  By default, these files are not deleted or monitored for size which could result in a potential operational problem or denial of service attack vector as these log files could grow uncontrolled filling all available disk space.  If stored on the system drive, this could cause the system's performance to become degraded to unacceptable levels or to fail completely.]]></RATIONALE>
