ARP cache poisoning can result in a denial of service, while ARP spoofing can result in system compromise, by redirecting the local host to a remote host that is not the desired target for communication, but an impostor.  As the risk of these attacks can be reduced by lowering the time an ARP query is stored in the cache, this value should be set appropriately.]]></RATIONALE>

ARP cache poisoning can result in a denial of service, while ARP spoofing can result in system compromise, by redirecting the local host to a remote host that is not the desired target for communication, but an impostor.

Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>

The usual manufacturer default is '022.'  If set at this value, when creating a new file, the resulting default permissions will be '644' (666 minus 022, i.e. -rw-r--r--).  When creating a new directory, these default permissions will be 755 (drwxr-xr-x), which sets the access level to (rwx r-x r-x): for owner (rwx), group (read/execute), other (read/execute) access on file access.  If users are not properly restricted, sensitive system or business information may be improperly disclosed.  The most restrictive setting is 077 and your default file permissions would be 600 (-rw-------) and your default directory permissions would be 700 (drwx------), thus becoming (rwx --- ---): for owner (rwx), group (no access), other (no access).

            <RATIONALE><![CDATA[One characteristic that makes 'user identification' via password a secure/workable solution is setting a 'password expiration' requirement.  Each time a new password is created, replacing one that has been in place for a given period of time, this resets the difficulty of breaking a password via brute-force to its maximum level; it can also help ensures that a compromised 'hack' account with a password that has expired is then closed.  While no 'secure maximum' for limiting the use of a password has been agreed upon, ninety (90) days is considered to be the maximum allowed for most enterprise environments.  However, this tactic must be used along with other password security factors, such as increasing the complexity the password set-space by requiring mixed-cases and/or special characters, to further increase the difficulty of breaking any password by brute-force attacks.]]></RATIONALE>

Without this minimum age requirement, any user(s) who wish to re-use the same password can merely cycle through a number of previously used passwords until returning to the preferred one (this is determined by the 'Password History' setting).  While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.  Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>

If these are not purged, it is possible that the information can be corrupted by an ARP attack.  The ARP cache is susceptible to two types of attacks: ARP cache poisoning and ARP spoofing.  ARP cache poisoning can result in a denial of service, while ARP spoofing can result in system compromise, by redirecting the local host to a remote host that is not the desired target for communication, but an impostor.  As the risk of these attacks can be reduced by lowering the time an ARP query is stored in the cache, this value should be set appropriately.]]></RATIONALE>

If these are not purged, it is possible that the information can be corrupted by an ARP attack.  The ARP cache is susceptible to two types of attacks: ARP cache poisoning and ARP spoofing.  ARP cache poisoning can result in a denial of service, while ARP spoofing can result in system compromise, by redirecting the local host to a remote host that is not the desired target for communication, but an impostor.  As the risk of these attacks can be reduced by lowering the time an ARP query is stored in the cache, this value should be set appropriately.]]></RATIONALE>

NOTE:  For Sun systems, beginning Solaris [5.]9, an administrator can totally disable NFS client access by deleting 'SUNWnfscr,' 'SUNWnfscu,' and SUNWnfscx,' but must re-install these if NFS is to be used later.]]></RATIONALE>

Without this minimum age requirement, any user(s) who wish to re-use the same password can merely cycle through a number of previously used passwords until returning to the preferred one (this is determined by the 'Password History' setting).  While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.  Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>

If these are not purged, it is possible that the information can be corrupted by an ARP attack.  The ARP cache is susceptible to two types of attacks: ARP cache poisoning and ARP spoofing.  ARP cache poisoning can result in a denial of service, while ARP spoofing can result in system compromise, by redirecting the local host to a remote host that is not the desired target for communication, but an impostor.  As the risk of these attacks can be reduced by lowering the time an ARP query is stored in the cache, this value should be set appropriately.]]></RATIONALE>

The usual manufacturer default is '022.'  If set at this value, when creating a new file, the resulting default permissions will be '644' (666 minus 022, i.e. -rw-r--r--).  When creating a new directory, these default permissions will be 755 (drwxr-xr-x), which sets the access level to (rwx r-x r-x): for owner (rwx), group (read/execute), other (read/execute) access on file access.  If users are not properly restricted, sensitive system or business information may be improperly disclosed.  The most restrictive setting is 077 and your default file permissions would be 600 (-rw-------) and your default directory permissions would be 700 (drwx------), thus becoming (rwx --- ---): for owner (rwx), group (no access), other (no access).  Also, as a malicious user could lay the groundwork for a privilege escalation attack by changing the UMASK value in this configuration file, access to this file and its UMASK setting should be restricted appropriately.]]></RATIONALE>

Each time a new password is created, replacing one that has been in place for a given period of time, this resets the difficulty of breaking a password via brute-force to its maximum level; it can also help ensures that a compromised 'hack' account with a password that has expired is then closed.  While no 'secure maximum' for limiting the use of a password has been agreed upon, ninety (90) days is considered to be the maximum allowed for most enterprise environments.  However, this tactic must be used along with other password security factors, such as increasing the complexity the password set-space by requiring mixed-cases and/or special characters, to further increase the difficulty of breaking any password by brute-force attacks.]]></RATIONALE>

Setting the failed login limit to an appropriate value locks the user account, which severely limits the speed of such attacks, making it more likely that the attacker's pattern will be noticed and the offending source address and/or port can be blocked.]]></RATIONALE>

Each time a new password is created, replacing one that has been in place for a given period of time, this resets the difficulty of breaking a password via brute-force to its maximum level; it can also help ensures that a compromised 'hack' account with a password that has expired is then closed.  While no 'secure maximum' for limiting the use of a password has been agreed upon, ninety (90) days is considered to be the maximum allowed for most enterprise environments.  However, this tactic must be used along with other password security factors, such as increasing the complexity the password set-space by requiring mixed-cases and/or special characters, to further increase the difficulty of breaking any password by brute-force attacks.]]></RATIONALE>

Due to concerns with stack-smashing attacks, the executable capabilities of the stack should be disabled or restricted as appropriate to the business environment.]]></RATIONALE>

ARP cache poisoning can result in a denial of service, while ARP spoofing can result in system compromise, by redirecting the local host to a remote host that is not the desired target for communication, but an impostor.

As the capability to run 'at' commands or modify 'crontab' file entries would be permitted by membership in the 'at.allow' and/or 'cron.allow' file lists, this could potentially allow the malicious scheduling of a job written to overwrite any system, log or user file.  As a result, the capability to modify either of these files should be restricted appropriately, to prevent data and/or system damage or host process subversion.]]></RATIONALE>

As this allows logging scans for out-of-bounds user activity and can help detect malicious/unauthorized actions, such as excessive file traffic or attempts to upload user files to protected directories, these logging capabilities for the 'inetd' and in the 'inetd.conf' configuration should be set as appropriate to the needs of the business.  CAUTION: Enabling command logging on FTP (HP-UX 11.x only) may put USER CREDENTIALS IN CLEAR TEXT FORMAT into the system logs, if someone accidentally types their password at the prompt.  Syslog information about FTP is deposited in the '/var/adm/syslog/syslog.log' directory, along with other system messages.  To capture FTP syslog information separately, it is possible to alter the '/etc/syslog.conf' file to put this information in a different, protected (077) file destination, which only root-level users can access.]]></RATIONALE>

Without this minimum age requirement, any user(s) who wish to re-use the same password can merely cycle through a number of previously used passwords until returning to the preferred one (this is determined by the 'Password History' setting).  While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.  Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>

Without this minimum age requirement, any user(s) who wish to re-use the same password can merely cycle through a number of previously used passwords until returning to the preferred one (this is determined by the 'Password History' setting).  While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.  Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>
