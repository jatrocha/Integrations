Without this minimum age requirement, any user(s) who wish to re-use the same password can merely cycle through a number of previously used passwords until returning to the preferred one (this is determined by the 'Password History' setting).  While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.  Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>

The most restrictive setting is 077 and your default file permissions would be 600 (-rw-------) and your default directory permissions would be 700 (drwx------), thus becoming (rwx --- ---): for owner (rwx), group (no access), other (no access).

            <RATIONALE><![CDATA[Among the characteristics that make 'user identification' via password a workable security solution is setting a 'minimum password age.'  Without this minimum age requirement, any user(s) who wish to re-use the same password can merely cycle through a number of previously used passwords until returning to the preferred one (this is determined by the 'Password History' setting).  While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.  Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>

If users are not properly restricted, sensitive system or business information may be improperly disclosed.  The most restrictive setting is 077 and your default file permissions would be 600 (-rw-------) and your default directory permissions would be 700 (drwx------), thus becoming (rwx --- ---): for owner (rwx), group (no access), other (no access).

Without this minimum age requirement, any user(s) who wish to re-use the same password can merely cycle through a number of previously used passwords until returning to the preferred one (this is determined by the 'Password History' setting).  While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.  Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>

When creating a new directory, these default permissions will be 755 (drwxr-xr-x), which sets the access level to (rwx r-x r-x): for owner (rwx), group (read/execute), other (read/execute) access on file access.  If users are not properly restricted, sensitive system or business information may be improperly disclosed.  The most restrictive setting is 077 and your default file permissions would be 600 (-rw-------) and your default directory permissions would be 700 (drwx------), thus becoming (rwx --- ---): for owner (rwx), group (no access), other (no access).

Without this minimum age requirement, any user(s) who wish to re-use the same password can merely cycle through a number of previously used passwords until returning to the preferred one (this is determined by the 'Password History' setting).  While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.  Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>

While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.  Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>

Without this minimum age requirement, any user(s) who wish to re-use the same password can merely cycle through a number of previously used passwords until returning to the preferred one (this is determined by the 'Password History' setting).  While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.  Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>

The usual manufacturer default is '022.'  If set at this value, when creating a new file, the resulting default permissions will be '644' (666 minus 022, i.e. -rw-r--r--).  When creating a new directory, these default permissions will be 755 (drwxr-xr-x), which sets the access level to (rwx r-x r-x): for owner (rwx), group (read/execute), other (read/execute) access on file access.  If users are not properly restricted, sensitive system or business information may be improperly disclosed.  The most restrictive setting is 077 and your default file permissions would be 600 (-rw-------) and your default directory permissions would be 700 (drwx------), thus becoming (rwx --- ---): for owner (rwx), group (no access), other (no access).

The most restrictive setting is 077 and your default file permissions would be 600 (-rw-------) and your default directory permissions would be 700 (drwx------), thus becoming (rwx --- ---): for owner (rwx), group (no access), other (no access).

Without this minimum age requirement, any user(s) who wish to re-use the same password can merely cycle through a number of previously used passwords until returning to the preferred one (this is determined by the 'Password History' setting).  While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.

As with all critical systems and devices, restricted permissions should be enabled, monitored and managed in accordance with the requirements and expectations of the business.]]></RATIONALE>

While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.

            <RATIONALE><![CDATA[Among the characteristics that make 'user identification' via password a workable security solution is setting a 'minimum password age.'  Without this minimum age requirement, any user(s) who wish to re-use the same password can merely cycle through a number of previously used passwords until returning to the preferred one (this is determined by the 'Password History' setting).  While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.  Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>

The most restrictive setting is 077 and your default file permissions would be 600 (-rw-------) and your default directory permissions would be 700 (drwx------), thus becoming (rwx --- ---): for owner (rwx), group (no access), other (no access).

Without this minimum age requirement, any user(s) who wish to re-use the same password can merely cycle through a number of previously used passwords until returning to the preferred one (this is determined by the 'Password History' setting).  While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.  Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>

While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.

While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.

While no specific 'minimum password age' can guarantee password security, one (1) day is generally considered to be the shortest length of time permissible, along with requiring other password security factors, such as increasing the variability of the symbol set-space by requiring mixed-cases, special characters, further increases the difficulty of breaking any password using brute-force methods.  Consider implementing this control for all account passwords in conjunction with CID 1318 (Password History) and CID 1071 (Minimum Password Length) and CID 1073 (Maximum Password Age).]]></RATIONALE>
